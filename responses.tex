\subsubsection*{Responses to Reviewer 040695887}

We appreciate that the reviewer describes this as an ``excellent proposal'', ``timely'', with ``strong justification'', ``large potential for impact'', that the team is ``world-leading in this area'' and that the requested resources are justified.

\subsubsection*{Responses to Reviewer 179276205}

We appreciate that the reviewer described the topic as ``absolutely essential'' and that the team ``knows exactly what is needed to progress this field''. We too appreciate our contact with the Met Office and ECMWF and our international links. They will be valuable to the project. We would also like to respond, first the points that the reviewer identified as strong:

\begin{enumerate}

\item \label{it:bounded} We agree that the project is achievable within three years. The work on the new convection parameterisation is achievable due to progress already made on multi-fluid convection parameterisation \cite[eg][]{WM19,TWV+18}.

\item \label{it:progression} We are excited that AFC-COSMIC has the potential to deliver accurate, conservative advection suitable for the next generation of atmosphere models.

\item \label{it:partners} We are delighted to be working with ECMWF and the UK Met Office who have different requirements, different approaches and different expertise. Adding this to the range of experience of the PIs, we are confident that we can deliver a big improvement in advection, drawing from experience in both structured and unstructured grid modelling.

\item \label{it:balance} We have every reason to believe and we agree that the COSMIC developments in the Met Office model with be straightforward and important, We also agree that the multi-fluid work is more risky but essential as mulit-fluid convection modelling is gaining momentum, has the potential to deliver big improvements in the representation of convection but requires a lot more work before it is usable. 

\item \label{it:PImips} PI Kent's expertise in intercomparison projects will indeed be invaluable in evaluating the advection schemes that are developed. 

\end{enumerate}
